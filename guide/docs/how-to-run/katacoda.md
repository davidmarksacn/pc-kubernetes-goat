# ðŸ”¥ Katacoda - Free Online Playground

We understand that most people stop trying out things and get distracted by notifications if they have to do some extra work. So we solved this problem by creating a single-click browser-based online free playground using Katacoda. You can just click the below playground and try out Kubernetes Goat in seconds right from your browser ðŸ¥³

Try out the free playground here: **[https://katacoda.com/madhuakula/scenarios/kubernetes-goat](https://katacoda.com/madhuakula/scenarios/kubernetes-goat)**
